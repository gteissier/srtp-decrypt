## srtp-util
srtp-util is a tool that deciphers SRTP / ciphers RTP packets contained in a network capture. It needs the Master Key
exchanged by other means to do its job. The output is dumped in such a way that output can be fed to text2pcap, to recreate a pcap.

_Refer Makefile for usage example_

## dependencies
SRTP part has been taken from VLC project. It depends on `libgcrypt` for ciphering and MAC.
Pcap processing is based on `libpcap`.

Typically, on Debian, 
`# apt-get install libpcap-dev libgcrypt-dev.`

## caveats
Isolating a single RTP flow from a network capture is a hard job, too hard to be done in this tool. Hence, srtp-util expects to process a single RTP flow.
Network capture shall not contain ICMP, ARP or reverse RTP flow for example, as those packets will not be deciphered correctly by the tool.
Moreover, RTP offset in frames is expected to be constant, by default 42, but can be set to 46 in case of 802.1q tagging.
